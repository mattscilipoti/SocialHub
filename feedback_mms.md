# Feedback from Matt (mms)

## Overview

Looks good overall.  Good job keeping your scope achievable.  Code is organized and formatted well.  Most items have a single responsibility.  It appears that you progressed smoothly, got your MVP working early, and took the time to review and improve.  Excellent!

## Project Workflow: How effectively did you plan, execute, and present this project?

Meets Expectations.  Nice readme.  Sharing the details about planning dir helped.  Good job.

For video, I recommend clarifying the purpose earlier.  Maybe showing a completed SocialHub, so we can see some examples?

Your commits show a good progression.  The comments could use a little more detail (9 x "Update README").  Adding Models and Controllers is an important step, I recommend committing after adding Users functionality, then continuing on to Hubs.


## Technical Requirements: How well does your app demonstrate a grasp of the technologies introduced in class?

Meets Expectations.  2 models? Check.  1 association? Check.  CRUD?  Check.

## Creativity / Interface: How memorable and enjoyable to use is your app?

Meets Expectations.  Visuals where quite appealing.  For Project 2, we are much more interested in  functionality -- and you did well there.

## Code Quality: How able would an uninformed programmer be to reuse and extend your code?

Meets Expectations: Code is organized and formatted well.  Most items have a single responsibility.  

There is some inconsistency (i.e. validations on User, but none on Hub, using strings for urls instead of named routed helpers).

## Deployment and Functionality: How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?

Meets Expectations: Deployed.  Works. Appealing.  A little confusing, but workable.  No url link on Github.

## Conclusion

Your average is a solid 2, meets expectations across the board.  Some nudging toward exceeds expectations.  Nice work.  Your progress is looking really good.
